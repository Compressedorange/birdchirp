This is a kaggle-based project, and so if you would like to run it, please create a new model (for the generator), a new dataset (for the dataset), and a new notebook with those plugged in as inputs. 
This isn't a particularly good model, and you're better off with others, but I just figured it would be a fun side project

Thank you very much for bothering to look at it though :)
